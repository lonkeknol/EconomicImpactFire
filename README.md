# EconomicImpactFire
## Introduction
JupyterLab implementation of case studies included within report Economic Impact of Fire - Cost and Impact of Fire Protection in Buildings. These JupyterLab codes demonstrate the application of a prototype methodology for the cost-benefit evaluation of investments in fire protection and were developed with support from the Fire Protection Research Foundation. The project was carried out from October 2021 to July 2022 in response to a Request for Proposal from the Foundation. The report has been prepared by Ruben Van Coile, Andrea Lucherini, and Ranjit Chaudary at Ghent University, Shuna Ni and David Unobe at Utah State University, and Thomas Gernay at Johns Hopkins University.

## Usage
The five case studies cover a range of building types and fire protection features. They are used for demonstration purpose and their outcomes should not be generalized to draw conclusions on effectiveness of particular fire protection measures for broad classes of buildings. Importantly, sensitivity analyses are provided to illustrate the effects of varying input data on the present net value. The sensitivity studies show the importance of input data in evaluating the cost-benefit analysis of fire protection measures. Through these sensitivity analyses, the methodology allows evaluating the robustness of the cost-benefit evaluations. The code allows users to input their own data in order to run calculations for their specific applications. The results of such evaluations can support decision making for policy makers, insurance companies, and individual building owners.
